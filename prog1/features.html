Implemented:
<ul>
    <li>After creating a line segment like the first assignment, a solid of revolution around x=0 is created</li>
    <li>Triangulated each face - The assignment says quads, and I started with those, but I upgraded to triangles</li>
    <li>Draw a vertical line down the center of the screen (which I remove when the user completes their SOR)</li>
    <li>Saving + Loading SOR (.OBJ) files</li>
    <li>Toggle button to view the normals of the faces of the SOR</li>
    <li>Equivalent of a game engine update function which brings the scene to life.</li>
    <li><a href="driver.html">Assignment</a></li>
